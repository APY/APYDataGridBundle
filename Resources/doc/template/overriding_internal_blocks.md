Overriding internal blocks
==========================

## External template

If you want to override blocks of the grid you can use a extended template of the grid template.

```twig
<!-- MyProjectMyBundle::my_page_grid.html.twig -->
{% extends 'APYDataGridBundle::blocks.html.twig' %}

{% block grid_pager %}{% endblock %}

{% block grid_column_id_address_filter %}
    {{ column.id }}
{% endblock grid_column_id_address_filter %}
```

This template can then be passed to the grid twig function as second parameter

```twig
<!-- MyProjectMyBundle::my_page.html.twig -->
{{ grid(data, 'MyProjectMyBundle::my_page_grid.html.twig') }}
```

You can also apply the template globaly to your whole app by specifing it in your config.

```yaml
apy_data_grid:
    theme: 'MyProjectMyBundle::my_page_grid.html.twig'
```

## _self template

If you want to override blocks inside the current template you can use the `_self` parameter in grid template definition.
Current template will automatically extended from the base block template (APYDataGridBundle::blocks.html.twig)

```twig
<!-- MyProjectMyBundle::my_grid.html.twig -->
{% extends 'MyProjectMyBundle::layout.html.twig' %}

{% block content %}
    {{ grid(grid, _self) }}
{% endblock content %}

{% block grid_pager %}{% endblock %}

{% block grid_column_id_address_filter %}
    {{ column.id }}
{% endblock grid_column_id_address_filter %}
```
**Note**: This trick works only with extended templates. Otherwises, blocks will be displayed twice.
**NoteÂ²**: Blocks have to be define after the call of the grid and outside others blocks.
